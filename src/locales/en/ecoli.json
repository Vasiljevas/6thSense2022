  "ECOLI-NAME": "Model organisms",
  "ECOLI-DESC": "Here you can see the E. coli bacteria. Even though it was first found in the feces of humans, now it is pivotal to the greatest scientific discoveries, like the molecular scissor technologyâ€”CRISPR. Due to its simple structure and uncomplicated conditions for reproduction E. coli has earned its place in laboratories all over the World. The better an organism is studied, the more likely it will be used for other research. Such organisms are called model organisms. Fruit flies, yeast and moulds are all examples of model organisms."
