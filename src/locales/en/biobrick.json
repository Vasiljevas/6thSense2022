  "BIOBRICK-NAME": "BioBrick",
  "BIOBRICK-DESC": "Did you know that DNA fragments are similar to LEGO blocks in how they work? Such pieces of DNA are called BioBricks, which can be ever reconstructed, much like the LEGO blocks displayed on the screen, giving an organism new properties. This is one of the basic principles of synthetic biology, or SynBio in short. Synthetic biology is a multidisciplinary field, which encompasses a broad range of methodologies from various disciplines, such as biology, engineering, chemistry, information technologies and mathematical modelling. It is a way of creating functions of organisms by changing the genetic information. These new functions aid in solving global environmental, health and industry issues. Developments in this field have been driven in part by the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), in which students compete presenting their scientific projects."
