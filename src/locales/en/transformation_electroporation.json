    "TRANSFORMATION-ELECTROPORATION-DESC-1": "Transformation is a way to incorporate new genetic material into a cell through its membrane (barrier separating cell organelles from the outside). Another method used to accomplish this is transformation by electroporation.<br></br><br></br>First of all, plasmids (genetic information in a ring form) have to be introduced to the solution of bacteria. Following that, an electric field is applied. Sending thousands of volts through the mixture creates holes in the bacterial membrane and allows plasmids, containing DNA information of the wanted protein, to pass through it. This process makes bacteria fragile, and because of that, they have to be handled carefully until the growth medium (bacterial food) is added, cells can regenerate and start producing the wanted protein. After the healing process, bacteria are plated on agar plates with appropriate antibiotic and only cells that have taken up the plasmid DNA are able to start expressing (making) the newly introduced antibiotic resistance genes, grow, divide and form colonies. <br></br><br></br>Compared to heat shock transformation, this method is more effective, meaning a larger part of cells contain desired plasmid, however, fewer cells survive this process than heat shock transformation. This technique is also more expensive because it requires special equipment.",
