    "GFP-NAME-1": "Green fluorescent protein",
    "GFP-DESC-1": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a protein that exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to light in the blue to ultraviolet range and has a major excitation peak at 395 nm. This protein was first extracted from a jellyfish variety called Aequorea victoria, but later it was found in corals and other water animals.<br></br><br></br>This protein is an important tool in many synthetic biology laboratories because when added to the end of other proteins it creates a way to visualize where proteins are stored, expressed, and used inside the cell. Because it is small, attaching it to larger proteins does not affect their function much. Another important factor is that it does not require additional enzymes to glow, which makes it easier for researchers to use. <br></br><br></br>On the right side of the model, a viral vector vaccine is shown. With some help from genetic engineering, a protein spike gene is inserted into a virus that is unable to reproduce. As a viral vector enters our body, it promotes the synthesis of viral protein spikes. Higher amounts of such protein promote an immune response.<br></br><br></br>The importance of this protein is so great, that the scientists who discovered it: Roger Y. Tsien, Osamu Shimomura, and Martin Chalfie, were awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008.",
