  "NANO-NAME": "Bacteriophages",
  "NANO-DESCRIPTION": "Bacteriophages (or phages for short) are a species of viruses, which infect bacteria, but do no harm to human cells. Their shape resembles a robot: they have a head in which they store their genetic information, a tail and legs, which they use to adhere to bacteria. Upon adherence to the bacterial surface, the bacteriophage injects its genetic code into the bacteria, forcing them to synthesize new viruses, which eventually exhausts the bacteria leading them to their death. As antibiotic resistance among bacteria increases, phage therapy is aiming to replace traditional antibiotic treatment methods. Thatâ€™s why scientists are trying to make phage therapy safer and more available to society."
