  "GFP-NAME": "Green fluorescent protein (GFP)",
  "GFP-DESCRIPTION": "Green fluorescent protein, or GFP, was first identified in a fluorescent jellyfish. Osamu Shimomura described the biophysics of how GFP fluoresces. A few years later, Martin Chalfie reported that GFP can be used in experiments with other organisms like bacteria and nematode. Later Roger Tsien designed variants of the GFP protein that could fluoresce cyan, blue and yellow. Shimomura, Chalfie and Tsien were awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2008 for their work in the discovery and development of this protein. What made GFP such an important tool in science is the fact that it’s “auto-catalytic” – it doesn’t need any co-factors or enzyme processing to fluoresce – so it can be easily used in a wide variety of organisms. To this day GFP is used in laboratories all over the world for protein and DNA research."
