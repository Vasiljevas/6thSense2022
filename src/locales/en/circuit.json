  "CIRCUIT-NAME": "Genetic circuit",
  "CIRCUIT-DESC": "Here you can see perhaps the most common tool used by scientists - plasmid, a DNA sequence in the form of a ring. While we know that DNA sequence of human chromosomes is infinitely long and highly twisted strand, this DNA sequence is quite different. The size of this entire plasmid is sometimes even smaller than the genes found on human chromosomes. However, the whole charm of the plasmid is the ability to insert our chosen genes into it. The plasmid itself is a closed ring composed of nucleotides A, T, G, C joined together according to certain rules. Because of the specific sites in the sequence, researchers can cut both strands of DNA in the plasmid and paste the selected gene into the plasmid. These sequences might encode various proteins, such as allergens or glowing proteins. Subsequently, proteins derived from these plasmids are used in a variety of studies to treat or detect a range of diseases, disorders, or mechanisms. Sometimes such plasmids can be used for a variety of commercial purposes, such as synthesizing dyes that can dye textiles."
