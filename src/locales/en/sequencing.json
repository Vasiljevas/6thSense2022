  "SEQUENCING-NAME": "DNA sequencing",
  "SEQUENCING-DESC": "All biological information about you is stored in your genome, which is made of DNA strands. These strands are made of even smaller parts, called nucleotides. Decoding of these strands can tell us a lot about a person, including their predisposition to certain diseases. The sequence of our genome is not visible to a naked eye—in order to be read DNA strands need to be pushed through a tiny protein hole located in an artificial membrane called a nanopore. A unidirectional electricity current is run through a nanopore, which is detected by a sensor. If there is an object in a nanopore, say a nucleotide, it disrupts the flow of electricity. The disruption differs depending on the object’s properties and a variation in the current flow is detected. Because A, T, C and G nucleotides are of different sizes and properties, when passing through a nanopore, they cause a unique change in the current flow. These unique changes are registered and help in identifying the sequence code in the form of A, T, C and G letters. This process is called DNA sequencing. "
